    "## Section 3: Model Compilation with Optimum CLI (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes before you get started\n",
    "\n",
    "> This section is *optional* since the compiled model was already made available at [Hugging Face - Mistral-7b-Insurance-Neuron](https://huggingface.co/aboavent/Mistral-7B-Insurance-neuron), however I strongly recommend you to read through this section as it'll provide additional insights on how to compile an existing model to the [AWS Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏰ Note: If you want to compile this model from scratch, please note that this step can take about 30-45 minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we compile the Mistral model using Hugging Face’s `optimum-cli` tool, which prepares it for efficient inference on AWS Inferentia instances with AWS Neuron. Model compilation is a critical step in optimizing performance, as it converts the model into a format compatible with AWS Neuron, enabling accelerated inference on hardware optimized for deep learning. As we are working with a Mistral LLM that requires full loading into compute memory for compilation, we recommend using a high-memory instance, such as **`inf2.24xlarge`**, **`inf2.48xlarge`**, or **`trn1.32xlarge`**. These instances offer substantial memory and Neuron cores, providing the resources necessary for efficient model processing and compiling tokenizers, `config.json`, and other essential components. You can perform this compilation step on an EC2 instance provisioned with [AWS Deep Learning AMI Neuron](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/appendix-ami-release-notes.html). After logging in to the instance, activate the pre-built transformers environment for Inf2 and Trn* by running: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source /opt/aws_neuronx_venv_transformers_neuronx/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for compiling the model into the AWS Neuron architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure Compilation Parameters**:\n",
    "   - To guide the model compilation process, we define several key parameters: `MODEL_ID` to specify the pretrained Mistral model from Hugging Face, `BATCH_SIZE` to determine the number of inputs processed per batch, and `SEQUENCE_LENGTH` to set the maximum input length, impacting both memory and processing time. We set `NUM_CORES` to define the number of Neuron cores used for parallelization, and `PRECISION` to `fp16` to balance memory usage and performance. Finally, `COMPILED_MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH` specifies where the Neuron-compatible compiled model will be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up Environment and Install Neuron Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Set up `pip` to use the Neuron repository and install `optimum` with NeuronX support to ensure compatibility with Inferentia hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Log in to Hugging Face**:\n",
    "   - Use the Hugging Face CLI to authenticate and enable access to the model repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run Optimum CLI for Model Compilation**:\n",
    "   - We use the Hugging Face `optimum-cli` tool to compile the model for AWS Inferentia hardware. The command includes the model ID, batch size, sequence length, number of cores, precision level, and output path.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a New Repository on Hugging Face and Upload the Compiled Model**:\n",
    "   - After compilation, create a new repository on Hugging Face to store the compiled model and upload the model files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Set Neuron repository for pip\n",
    "pip config set global.extra-index-url https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install optimum with NeuronX support and update dependencies\n",
    "pip install --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[neuronx]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log in to Hugging Face\n",
    "huggingface-cli login --token $HF_TOKEN\n",
    "\n",
    "# Export model for Neuron\n",
    "optimum-cli export neuron \\\n",
    "    -m $MODEL_ID \\\n",
    "    --batch_size $BATCH_SIZE \\\n",
    "    --sequence_length $SEQUENCE_LENGTH \\\n",
    "    --num_cores $NUM_CORES \\\n",
    "    --auto_cast_type $PRECISION \\\n",
    "    --trust-remote-code \\\n",
    "    $COMPILED_MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new repository on Hugging Face and upload the compiled model \n",
    "huggingface-cli repo create $MODEL_OUTPUT_NAME\n",
    "huggingface-cli upload $HF_MODEL_ID_TO_PUSH $COMPILED_MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH ./\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Compile the Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimized for Inferentia**: Compilation enables the model to leverage the specialized capabilities of AWS Inferentia, reducing inference latency and improving cost-efficiency.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Using `fp16` precision and Neuron-compatible optimizations helps reduce memory usage, allowing for higher throughput.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: A compiled model is more scalable and cost-effective in production, making it ideal for customer support applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Section 6: Convert Model to Safetensors Format for Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we convert the compiled Mistral model into the `safetensors` format, which is a lightweight and efficient file format designed for securely storing large model weights. This conversion is necessary to make the model compatible with Amazon Bedrock, allowing us to easily import and use the model within the Bedrock environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Note\n",
    "> For this conversion, it is recommended to use a larger instance  with **at least 128 GB of memory**. This ensures sufficient resources for loading and processing the entire model during the conversion process. Attempting this step on smaller instances may result in memory-related errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in This Section\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Conversion Function**:\n",
    "   - We define a `convert_to_safetensors` function that loads the model and its tokenizer, then saves them in `safetensors` format.\n",
    "   - The function uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the model and save it in the `safetensors` format for compatibility with Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run Conversion**:\n",
    "   - Call the `convert_to_safetensors` function, specifying the model name (`MODEL_ID`) and the directory (`save_directory`) where the converted model files will be saved.\n",
    "   - This process generates two outputs:\n",
    "      - The model in `safetensors` format.\n",
    "      - The tokenizer, saved alongside the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify Conversion**:\n",
    "   - After conversion, we list the contents of the target directory (`save_directory`) to confirm that the model files have been saved correctly in the desired format.\n",

    "   - **`imported_model_name`**: Provides a user-friendly name for the model once it’s imported to Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "   - **`job_name`**: Generates a unique name for the model import job by appending a timestamp, ensuring that each job has a unique identifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we track the status of our model import job in Amazon Bedrock to ensure that the model is successfully imported and ready for deployment. Since model import jobs can take time, a periodic status check allows us to monitor the progress and handle any errors that may arise.\n",

    "5. **Set `imported_model_id` for Further Use**:\n",
    "   - Once the job completes successfully, `imported_model_id` is assigned the value of `importedModelArn`, which will be used to interact with the model in subsequent steps.\n",

    "## Section 12: Call Imported Model Using Amazon Bedrock Converse Streaming API\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we demonstrate how to use Amazon Bedrock's Converse Streaming API to interact with our imported model in real-time. The Converse Streaming API allows us to receive responses from the model as they are generated, providing a more interactive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps in This Section\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Sample Messages**:\n",
    "   - We create a list of sample messages to simulate different customer support queries related to insurance. Each message serves as a prompt for the model to respond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inference Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Set parameters such as `temperature` and `top_k` in `inference_config` and `additional_model_fields` to control the model's response style and randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the `stream_conversation` Function**:\n",
    "   - The `stream_conversation` function uses the `converse_stream` method to send messages to the model and receive responses in a streamed format.\n",
    "   - Parameters:\n",
    "      - **`bedrock_client`**: The Bedrock runtime client initialized for the specified region.\n",
    "      - **`model_id`**: The ARN of the imported model, used to identify the model for inference.\n",
    "      - **`messages`**: The list of conversation messages to send.\n",
    "      - **`inference_config` and `additional_model_fields`**: Configurations that determine the response style and sampling behavior.\n",
    "   - As the response stream is received, the function processes different event types:\n",
    "      - **`messageStart`**: Indicates the start of a new message from the model.\n",
    "      - **`contentBlockDelta`**: Contains partial content from the model’s response, which is printed in real-time.\n",
    "      - **`messageStop`**: Marks the end of a message, including information on the stop reason.\n",
    "      - **`metadata`**: Provides metrics on token usage and latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Streaming API for Multiple Test Cases**:\n",
    "   - We loop through each sample message in `sample_messages`, calling `stream_conversation` for each to receive and display responses from the model.\n",
    "   - This approach allows us to simulate different customer queries and observe how the model responds in real-time to each prompt.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we walked through the end-to-end process of deploying a fine-tuned Mistral model for insurance-related customer support on two different AWS platforms: Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. This exercise provided a comprehensive look at how to optimize, deploy, and interact with a Mistral model using AWS’s specialized infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you should now have an understanding of:\n",
    "- **Model Optimization and Compilation**: How to prepare a model for efficient deployment on AWS Inferentia instances using Neuron, including the compilation of a Hugging Face model to a Neuron-compatible format with `optimum-cli`.\n",
    "- **Deploying Models on Amazon SageMaker**: How to set up and deploy the model on a `ml.inf2.xlarge` instance, leveraging SageMaker’s managed inference capabilities for low-latency, cost-effective serving.\n",
    "- **Converting Models for Amazon Bedrock**: How to convert the model to Hugging Face’s `safetensors` format and upload it to Amazon S3 for import into Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "- **Using Amazon Bedrock's Converse API**: How to use the Bedrock Converse API to query the model, including real-time streaming of responses for enhanced interactivity.\n",
    "- **Building an Interactive Application with Streamlit**: How to connect both deployed models (SageMaker and Bedrock) to a custom chatbot interface, providing a hands-on experience for interacting with the model through a simple UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Proposition\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques demonstrated in this notebook highlight the versatility and scalability of AWS’s machine learning and AI infrastructure:\n",
    "- **Cost-Effective Inference**: With Inferentia-based SageMaker deployment, we can run high-performance inferences while minimizing costs.\n",
    "- **Flexibility Across Platforms**: Amazon Bedrock provides a flexible environment for model hosting and deployment, enabling broader access to generative AI.\n",
    "- **Seamless User Interaction**: By connecting the models to a Streamlit app, we created an accessible interface that makes it easy for end-users to interact with the model and get real-time responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow demonstrated a full deployment lifecycle, from model preparation and compilation to deployment, interaction, and user application, empowering you to build scalable AI solutions on AWS. With these skills, you’re now well-equipped to deploy similar language models across different AWS environments to meet diverse operational needs.\n"
