This means that for every 2 blue chairs, there are 3 red chairs.  We can express this relationship as: B/R = 2/3  We also know that the total number of chairs is 30: B + R = 30  Now, we can solve these equations to find the number of blue chairs.  From the ratio B/R = 2/3, we can express B in terms of R: B = (2/3) * R  Substitute this expression for B into the total number of chairs equation: (2/3) * R + R = 30  To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 3: (2/3) * R + (3/3) * R = 30 (2R + 3R) / 3 = 30 5R / 3 = 30  Now, multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator: 5R = 90  Divide both sides by 5 to solve for R: R = 90 / 5 R = 18  Now that we know there are 18 red chairs, we can find the number of blue chairs using the ratio B/R = 2/3: B = (2/3) * R B = (2/3) * 18 B = 12  So, there are 12 blue chairs in the classroom.</td>\n",

To find out how many groups of 5 chairs there are, we divide the total number of chairs by the size of one group: 30 chairs / 5 chairs/group = 6 groups. 4. Since there are 2 blue chairs in each group, we can find the total number of blue chairs by multiplying the number of groups by the number of blue chairs per group: 6 groups * 2 blue chairs/group = 12 blue chairs.

    "### 3. How to tackle complex, multi-step tasks\n",
    "When faced with complex, multi-step tasks, prompting can be a significant challenge. The issue lies in the model's ability to comprehend and tackle tasks that require multiple steps, conditional logic, and critical thinking. Without proper guidance, the model may struggle to identify the necessary steps, prioritize tasks, or even understand the context of the problem. This can lead to incomplete, inaccurate, or irrelevant responses. Furthermore, complex tasks often require a deep understanding of the problem domain, making it difficult for the model to generate a coherent and logical solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Decompose the complex task into a sequence of simpler sub-tasks in the prompt. Guide the model to solve each sub-task step-by-step. Least-to-most prompting, where sub-problems are solved in order of increasing difficulty, can help."

Also, for large values of n, the function will exceed the maximum recursion depth due to multiple nested calls.  Efficiency: The function's efficiency is very poor due to the repeated computation of Fibonacci numbers. For example, when calculating fibonacci(5), the function calls fibonacci(4) and fibonacci(3), which in turn call fibonacci(3) and fibonacci(2), and so on. This leads to an exponential time complexity.  To improve the efficiency, we can use dynamic programming to store and reuse the calculated Fibonacci numbers. Here's an optimized version of the function:  def fibonacci(n, memo={}): if n &lt;= 0: return 0 elif n == 1: return 1 elif n in memo: return memo[n] else: result = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo) memo[n] = result return result  This version has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it much more efficient than the original implementation.</td>\n",

This redundancy leads to an exponential time complexity of O(2^n). A more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming or iteration to calculate each number in the sequence only once.</td>\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we discussed the common pitfalls that can arise when dealing with prompts and large language models (LLMs). These pitfalls include hallucination and factual inaccuracies, lack of coherence and logical reasoning in generated text, difficulty with complex multi-step tasks, and misunderstanding user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then explored how to create strong prompts and the importance of prompt engineering techniques to mitigate these issues. The key prompt engineering techniques covered were zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting relies solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge without any additional examples. Few-shot prompting provides a small number of examples to guide the model's outputs. CoT prompting encourages the model to explain its reasoning process step-by-step, which is particularly useful for complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the differences between the different Mistral AI models and their respective use cases. While Mixtral 8x7b can provide analytical responses, Mistral Large 2 offers more thorough and contextually aware outputs, especially for multilingual tasks. We also introduced the Function Calling capabaility with the Response API. \n"
