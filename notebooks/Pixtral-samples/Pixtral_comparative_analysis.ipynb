    "# Pixtral: A Comparative Analysis of Vision Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a structured and in-depth comparison of Pixtral, a cutting-edge vision model, against select peers such as Amazon Nova Pro, Anthropic’s Haiku 3 (excluding version 3.5) and Llama 3.2 11b. Our primary goal is to evaluate Pixtral’s performance, identify its strengths and limitations, and establish best practices for integrating Pixtral into workflows that demand accurate and efficient image understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will conduct a series of controlled tests and qualitative assessments, leveraging services like the Converse API, Amazon Bedrock, and a SageMaker inference endpoint for Pixtral. In addition to exploring model outputs on various image types—ranging from general object recognition tasks to financial document analysis and handwriting transcription—we will employ a judging model (Sonnet 3.5) to systematically evaluate and rank the quality of responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, the notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to efficiently use Pixtral’s endpoints for real-time inference.\n",
    "- Compare Pixtral’s capabilities to other leading vision models using standardized prompts and test images.\n",
    "- Help you understand the relative advantages of Pixtral, guiding you in deciding when and how to deploy it in your own applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have included licensing details and quick-start references for further exploration. By the end of this analysis, you should have a clear perspective on Pixtral’s performance profile and actionable insights into optimizing its use in your specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "All example outputs have been preserved in this notebook, allowing you to review the results without needing to run the code on your own instance or pay for compute costs. \n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Across multiple scenarios, the models—Nova, Claude Haiku, Llama 3.2, and Pixtral—demonstrated varying strengths and weaknesses. The evaluations were conducted with the assistance of a judging LLM (Sonnet 3.5), which assessed clarity, completeness, accuracy, and overall descriptive quality. The following summarizes the key observations from each test scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Household Cleaner Image:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When describing two bottles of disinfectant surface cleaner, Pixtral’s response was judged superior. It provided a highly detailed, visually rich description, accurately capturing colors, branding elements, and design motifs that the other models overlooked. This suggests Pixtral’s strong capability for nuanced visual analysis of everyday objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Document Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an Amazon financial statement image, Pixtral again excelled. It offered a well-structured, comprehensive breakdown of financial metrics and contextualized the company’s performance effectively. The model’s balanced approach—combining raw data extraction with insightful commentary—surpassed the more limited or less organized presentations from Claude and Llama.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handwriting Transcription:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For handwriting recognition, none of the models performed perfectly. However, the judge deemed Claude’s response the least inaccurate, as it introduced fewer extraneous words compared to Llama and Pixtral. This scenario highlights a challenge for all tested models: accurately parsing handwritten text. While Claude edged ahead here, the overall quality from all three remained suboptimal. The author isn't entirely sure what the second to third to last word is. None of the models were correct, however, Claude did not introduce additional words while Pixtral and Llama did.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chart/Graph Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a chart of North American segment results, Pixtral outperformed the others. It displayed an impressive level of detail, correctly interpreting data points, capturing year-over-year changes, and providing a clear, logical structure. The model’s ability to handle numeric data and present it contextually was a standout feature, reaffirming Pixtral’s strength in scenarios where clarity and thoroughness are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indoor Scene Description (Dresser Image):**\n",
    "\n",
    "In describing a minimalist indoor space, Llama was selected as the winner. It provided granular detail, accurately noted subtle elements like a corkboard and shelf, and gave a clear sense of the environment’s purpose and ambiance. Although Pixtral and Claude produced competent descriptions, Llama’s richer detail and organization gave it the edge in this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insurance Form Data Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing medical insurance verification forms, Llama demonstrated a great performance by correctly identifying most information and maintaining proper JSON structure, while other models relied on generic placeholder data. Though Llama and Nova misinterpreted some information, their accurate field capture and standardized formatting outperformed Claude and Pixtral, highlighting both progress and persistent challenges in automated document processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traffic Scene Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing this traffic scene, Pixtral was selected as the winner. Compared to the other models, it excelled by providing a comprehensive and naturally flowing description of the image. When answering the prompt's questions, Pixtral spots information 'hidden' in one of the image's details, that was not detected by other models. However, it needs to be noted, that Pixtral provides incorrect information with respect to this detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mapping latency by input & output token counts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining median (p50) performance, Pixtral demonstrates better first-token response times (0.07-0.94s), outperforming all other models. This advantage is expected, as Pixtral operates on Amazon SageMaker with dedicated resources and direct infrastructure access. The remaining models, running on Amazon Bedrock, are constrained by default service quotas that limit their concurrent requests and processing capacity. Claude Haiku maintains consistent performance with first-token times ranging from 0.3-2.22s. Llama 3.2 shows moderate performance with first-token times of 0.4-3.77s, while Amazon Nova Pro exhibits the highest latency, ranging from 3.01-12.2s.\n",
    "The tail latencies (p99) indicate that Pixtral maintains relatively stable performance even in edge cases, while other models experience more significant performance degradation, particularly with larger token counts. Time-to-last-token metrics follow similar patterns, though with higher absolute values across all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pixtral frequently delivered the most comprehensive and structured analyses, particularly for tasks requiring detailed, multi-level descriptions of data-rich images (e.g., financial statements, charts, and product details).** Its performance in these areas suggests that it is a strong candidate for use cases demanding thorough and accurate visual summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama 3.2 excelled in capturing intricate details within certain contexts, as seen in the indoor scene description. Its strength appears to lie in careful observation and nuanced environmental portrayal, making it a good fit for tasks requiring a keen eye for subtle elements and layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Haiku generally produced reasonable summaries but often lacked the depth or precision of the others. It performed best in the handwriting scenario, possibly due to simpler transcription logic relative to the errors the others introduced. While Claude’s descriptions are understandable and coherent, they may not always match the richer level of detail and analysis provided by Pixtral or Llama.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nova excels at structured document processing, demonstrating superior performance in form data extraction through accurate field identification and JSON structuring. While showing limitations with dates and numbers, its performance indicates strong potential for document automation, fitting well within the broader ecosystem of specialized vision-language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, all four models have their merits and shortcomings. Pixtral stands out for structured, data-heavy image analyses; Llama shines in scenario-based detail and compositional complexity; Nova excels at document processing and form data extraction; Claude is a steady if less detailed performer, excelling occasionally in simpler tasks like handwriting. Depending on the complexity of the use case and the type of image being processed, each model could be the right choice."
