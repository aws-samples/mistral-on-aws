    "# Multi-Agent Collaboration and Orchestration using LangGraph for Mistral Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated multi-agent system built with LangGraph and powered by Amazon Bedrock and Mistral. This Multi-Agent City Information System provides comprehensive information about a city, including events, weather, activities, and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals and Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to demonstrate and achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integration and Orchestration:\n",
    "   - Showcase the integration of Mistral with AWS services for building complex LLM applications.\n",
    "   - Demonstrate the power of LangGraph in creating and orchestrating multi-agent systems.\n",
    "   - Illustrate the integration of various data sources and APIs within a multi-agent framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comprehensive City Information System:\n",
    "   Create a multi-agent system that delivers:\n",
    "   - Upcoming events information:\n",
    "     * Retrieved from a local SQLite database\n",
    "     * Searched online using the Tavily API when local data is unavailable\n",
    "   - Current weather information and analysis using the OpenWeatherMap API\n",
    "   - Suggested activities based on events and weather conditions\n",
    "   - Outfit recommendations considering the weather\n",
    "\n",
    "3. System Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
    "   - Demonstrate the system's ability to handle varying levels of available information across different cities.\n",
    "   - Showcase the seamless switching between local and online data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Analysis and Synthesis:\n",
    "   - Provide a final analysis that combines event and weather information into coherent and useful recommendations for city visitors or residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Multi-Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Each agent focuses on a specific task, making the system easier to maintain and extend.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Agents can be easily added, removed, or modified without affecting the entire system.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The system can handle complex workflows by distributing tasks among multiple agents.\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Parallel processing of tasks by different agents can lead to faster results.\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Each agent can be optimized for its specific task, improving overall system efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a powerful framework for building multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a structured way to define and manage the flow of information between agents.\n",
    "- Offer built-in support for state management and checkpointing.\n",
    "- Allow for easy visualization of the agent workflow.\n",
    "- Integrate well with large language models and other AI tools.\n",
    "- Support conditional routing, enabling dynamic workflow adjustments based on intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Our multi-agent system consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EventsDB Tool**: Queries a local SQLite database for event information.\n",
    "2. **Search Tool**: Utilizes the Tavily API to search for online event information when local data is unavailable.\n",
    "3. **Weather Tool**: Fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
    "4. **Analysis Node**: Synthesizes information from other agents to provide comprehensive recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Amazon Bedrock**: For accessing the Mistral large language model\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: For orchestrating the multi-agent system\n",
    "- **Langchain**: For building the RAG pipeline and other LLM interactions\n",
    "- **SQLite**: For local event database storage\n",
    "- **Tavily API**: For online event searches\n",
    "- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For current weather data\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a clear understanding of how to build a sophisticated multi-agent system that can process and synthesize information from various sources, adapting to different scenarios and data availability to provide valuable insights about a city.\n"

      "    \"analysis_result\": \"1. Weather Analysis: The current weather in Philadelphia is scattered clouds with a temperature of 31.38\\u00b0C, feeling like 38.31\\u00b0C due to humidity at 69%. The wind speed is 3.6 m/s from the south. It's a hot day, but the cloud cover provides some relief from direct sunlight.\\n\\n2. Suggested Activities: Given the warm weather, outdoor activities are suitable. The Philadelphia Flower Show on March 2nd would be a great choice as it's an indoor event, providing a comfortable environment to enjoy elaborate garden displays. However, as this event is not imminent, consider visiting a local park or garden to enjoy the current warm weather. The Wawa Welcome America festival in June would also be a good fit for the current weather, with outdoor concerts, fireworks, and historical reenactments. The Philadelphia Film Festival in October might be too warm for some, but theaters are typically air-conditioned.\\n\\n3. Outfit Recommendations: Considering the high temperature and humidity, lightweight, breathable clothing is recommended. Opt for shorts, t-shirts, sundresses, or light linen pants. Don't forget sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen to protect from the sun. Stay hydrated throughout the day.\\n\\n4. Restaurant Recommendations:\\n   - **Acadia**: A moderately-priced restaurant that's dog-friendly and offers free WiFi and bike parking. Ideal for a casual meal.\\n   - **BAP**: An inexpensive option with a quiet, casual ambiance. Good for families with kids and those who prefer a non-alcoholic setting.\\n   - **The Love**: A romantic, intimate, and trendy restaurant suitable for various meals. The full bar makes it a great choice for a night out.\\n   - **Shanghai Station**: A moderately-priced restaurant that's good for families. The availability of karaoke adds an element of fun.\\n   - **Bar One**: A hipster spot that's good for groups. It's a moderately-priced option for a casual meal or drinks.\",\n",

    "### Analysis of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tampa, Florida**:\n",
    "   - Events: Not found in the local database, triggering the search tool.\n",
    "   - Weather: Retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
    "   - Restaurants: Recommendations provided through the RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**:\n",
    "   - Events: Found in the local database.\n",
    "   - Weather: Retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
    "   - Restaurants: Recommendations provided through the RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **New York, New York**:\n",
    "   - Events: Found in the local database.\n",
    "   - Weather: Retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
    "   - Restaurants: No recommendations available in the RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarities:\n",
    "- All three cases utilized the weather tool to fetch current weather information.\n",
    "- The analysis node provided recommendations based on available data for each city.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences:\n",
    "- Tampa required the use of the search tool for event information, while Philadelphia and New York used the local database.\n",
    "- Philadelphia had both local event data and restaurant recommendations, providing the most comprehensive results.\n",
    "- New York had local event data but lacked restaurant recommendations, showcasing the system's ability to work with partial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations:\n",
    "1. The system adapts to available data sources, seamlessly switching between local and online searches for event information.\n",
    "2. Weather information is consistently provided, forming a core part of the recommendations.\n",
    "3. The RAG system for restaurant recommendations enhances the output when data is available but doesn't hinder the overall functionality when it's not.\n",
    "4. The analysis node demonstrates flexibility in synthesizing varying levels of information to provide useful recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-city comparison highlights the robustness and adaptability of our multi-agent system, showcasing its ability to provide valuable insights even when faced with varying levels of available information across different cities.\n",
