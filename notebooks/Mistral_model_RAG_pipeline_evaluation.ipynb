    "# Advanced RAG Pipeline for Mistral Models with Q&A Automation and Model Evaluation using LlamaIndex and Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well in the `Data Science 3.0` kernel on Amazon SageMaker Studio. It requires Python v3.10+*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to evaluate the performance of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The RAG pipeline leverages a retriever component to identify relevant context from a knowledge base and a generator component to produce fluent and informative responses based on the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the RAG pipeline using the [LlamaIndex Evaluation library](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/optimizing/evaluation/evaluation), which provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and evaluating question-answering systems. Additionally, we will utilize the [Ragas](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/stable/) (RAG Assessment) framework, designed specifically for assessing the performance of RAG models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Need Evaluators like LlamaIndex Evaluators and Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "We need evaluators like LlamaIndex evaluators and Ragas in a RAG pipeline primarily because language models, including those used in the RAG pipeline, can suffer from issues like hallucination, factual inconsistencies, and biases. Evaluators help us assess the performance and reliability of the RAG pipeline, ensuring that it provides accurate, relevant, and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigating Hallucination**: Language models, especially large language models used in RAG pipelines, can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or made-up information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Evaluators help identify instances of hallucination by comparing the generated responses against the ground truth or the source knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensuring Faithfulness and Factual Correctness**: Evaluators assess the faithfulness and factual correctness of the generated responses by comparing them with the source knowledge base or reference data. This is crucial in domains where accurate and reliable information is essential, such as healthcare, finance, or legal contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measuring Relevance and Context Understanding**: Evaluators can measure how relevant and contextually appropriate the generated responses are, given the input query and the retrieved context from the knowledge base. This helps identify cases where the RAG pipeline fails to understand the query or retrieves irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quantifying Performance**: Evaluators provide quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which allow for objective comparisons of different RAG pipeline configurations, retriever-generator model combinations, or training strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identifying Biases and Inconsistencies**: Evaluators can help identify biases and inconsistencies in the generated responses, which may arise due to biases in the training data or the language model itself. This is important for ensuring fairness and avoiding potentially harmful biases in the RAG pipeline's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tailored Evaluation**: Frameworks like Ragas provide a structured approach to creating tailored test sets and evaluating the RAG pipeline's performance on specific types of queries or domains, allowing for more targeted assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement the RAG pipeline**: We will set up the RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex, configuring the retriever and generator components according to best practices. Mistral 7B Instruct LLM will be utilized as the generator component in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create and evaluate the LlamaIndex Query Engine**: We will create a LlamaIndex Query Engine to facilitate efficient retrieval and generation of answers from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate test sets with LlamaIndex RagDatasetGenerator and Ragas TestsetGenerator**: To evaluate the RAG pipeline's performance, we will generate synthetic test sets using LlamaIndex [RagDatasetGenerator module](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llama_dataset/labelled-rag-datasets/). In this example, **Mistral 7B Instruct** model will be used to generate Q&A pairs (including \"ground truth\") for the synthetic dataset. Additionally, we will leverage the Ragas [TestsetGenerator module](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/latest/getstarted/testset_generation.html) to create tailored test sets aligned with our specific needs. As for the Ragas section, only Mistral 7B Instruct will be utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate pipeline performance using LlamaIndex evaluators and Ragas**: We will leverage both the LlamaIndex evaluators and the Ragas framework to comprehensively assess the performance of the RAG pipeline on a range of question-answering tasks. Using the generated test sets, we will analyze metrics such as faithfulness, relevancy, correctness, and other relevant measures to gain insights into the pipeline's strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we expect to achieve the following outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A functional RAG pipeline implemented using LlamaIndex, capable of answering questions based on a knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A LlamaIndex Query Engine for efficient retrieval and generation of answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Synthetic test sets generated using LlamaIndex RagDatasetGenerator and tailored test sets created with the Ragas TestsetGenerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comprehensive performance evaluation of the RAG pipeline using both LlamaIndex evaluators and the Ragas framework, including quantitative metrics such as faithfulness, relevancy, correctness, semantic similarity, and other relevant measures, as well as qualitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Insights into the impact of different pipeline configurations on performance and identification of limitations and potential areas for improvement in the RAG pipeline.\n"

    "\n",
    "To start exploring RAG patterns with a practical example, we'll first install some libraries that might not be present in the default notebook kernel image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pythonsdk/) AWS Python SDKs `boto3` and `botocore` to be able to call the service\n",
    "- [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/) is an open-source framework to help integrate LLMs with trusted data sources, and measure the performance of data-connected LLM use-cases\n",
    "- [Ragas](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/stable/) is a framework that helps you evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines\n",
    "- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is an open-source framework for orchestrating common LLM patterns. In this example, it's only used with Ragas as an optional step to generate test dataset via langchain docs. The entire RAG pipeline in this example is implemented with LlamaIndex though.\n",

    "\n",
    "Text vectorization models are machine learning models that convert text data into numerical vector representations. This process, known as vectorization, allows the text to be processed and analyzed using mathematical operations and algorithms. They typically place an upper limit on the length of text they can process as a single item. Additionally, we want each search result to be reasonably short for embedding results in the answer generation LLM prompt later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we need to **split** the source document into shorter passages for indexing. LlamaIndex's [TokenTextSplitter](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/#tokentextsplitter) offers a utility for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing **chunk_size** and **chunk_overlap** values for the TokenTextSplitter involves a trade-off between computational efficiency and preserving context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger chunk sizes can help capture more context and meaning within each chunk, which is beneficial for tasks that require understanding the broader context of the text. However, larger chunk sizes also increase the computational requirements for processing each chunk, as more tokens need to be processed at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunk overlap helps maintain continuity and context between adjacent chunks by including some overlapping text. This overlap can be particularly useful when processing text sequentially, as it provides some context from the previous chunk, which can aid in understanding the current chunk. A larger overlap can help preserve more context, but it also increases redundancy and computational overhead, as the same tokens are processed multiple times across overlapping chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the chunk size and overlap must be optimized for the specific NLP task at hand(e.g., text summarization and Q&A), where preserving context is crucial,  and strike a balance between preserving context and keeping the computational requirements manageable."

The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality.

We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.', 'transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One\\nMedical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question.', 'Thebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard.

Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business.', 'Customersdon’t want only one model.

We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.', 'transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One\\nMedical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question.', 'Thebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', '(More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using LLM Evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing LLM evaluators like LlamaIndex's evaluator and Ragas can provide valuable insights into the performance and reliability of your RAG pipeline as you have explored along this example, particularly when evaluating the outputs of language models such as Mistral. Here are some key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Response Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM evaluators can help assess the quality of the responses generated by your RAG pipeline by comparing them against various criteria, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correctness**: Evaluating if the generated answer matches the reference or ground truth answer, if available\n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**: Measuring the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the reference answer, even if they differ in wording.\n",
    "- **Faithfulness**: Determining if the generated answer is faithful to the retrieved context, avoiding hallucinations or irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Retrieval Relevance\n",
    "These evaluators can also assess the relevance of the retrieved context to the input query, ensuring that the RAG pipeline is providing appropriate information to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guideline Adherence\n",
    "Evaluators like LlamaIndex and Ragas, can evaluate if the generated responses adhere to specific guidelines or constraints, which is crucial for maintaining control over the language model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Question Generation\n",
    "Tools like LlamaIndex and Ragas can automatically generate questions based on your data, allowing you to test your RAG pipeline's performance on a diverse set of queries without manual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these evaluation capabilities, you can systematically identify areas for improvement in your RAG pipeline, retrieval components, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and reliability of your Generative AI-powered applications."
