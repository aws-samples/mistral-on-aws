    "In this notebook, we walk through the basics of how you can get started with compiling models for AWS Neuron to deploy on Inferentia2 instances.\n",
    "AWS Neuron is an SDK with a compiler, runtime, and profiling tools that unlocks high-performance and cost-effective deep learning (DL) acceleration. It supports high-performance training on AWS Trainium-based Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Trn1 instances. For model deployment, it supports high-performance and low-latency inference on AWS Inferentia-based Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances and AWS Inferentia2-based Amazon EC2 Inf2 instances. With Neuron, you can use popular frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and optimally train and deploy machine learning (ML) models on Amazon EC2 Trn1, Inf1, and Inf2 instances, and Neuron is designed to minimize code changes and tie-in to vendor-specific solutions."

We will utilize the Hugging Face LLM DLC, a purpose-built Inference Container designed to facilitate the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a secure and managed environment. This Deep Learning Container (DLC) is powered by <b>Text Generation Inference (TGI)</b>, a scalable and optimized solution for deploying and serving LLMs efficiently. Detailed instance requirements for various model sizes will also be provided to ensure optimal deployment configurations.

    "\n",
    "#### Local Setup (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a local server, follow these steps to execute this jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure AWS CLI**: Configure [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) with your AWS credentials. Run `aws configure` and enter your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and default output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install required libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries for working with SageMaker, such as [sagemaker](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/), [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3), and others. You can use a Python environment manager like [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to manage your Python packages in your preferred IDE (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create an IAM role for SageMaker**: Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants your user [SageMaker permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-roles.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can set up a local Jupyter Notebook environment capable of deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker using the appropriate IAM role for granting the necessary permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook can be run on a t3.medium instance (ml.t3.medium). However, to deploy mistral models to an Inf2 endpoint, you may need to request a quota increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "To request a quota increase, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/).\n",
    "2. Choose Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "3. Review your default quota for the following resources:\n",
    "   - `ml.inf2.24xlarge` for endpoint usage `or`\n",
    "   - `ml.inf2.48xlarge` for endpoint usage\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ( Note that although this example showcases Mistral Large 2 ( which has been compiled to run on 24 Neuron cores) with inf2.48xlarge, you are still able to deploy and benchmark other models compiled for 12 cores (inf2.24xlarge)  such as [Codestral-neuron](https://huggingface.co/nithiyn/codestral-neuron) and [Mathstral-neuron](https://huggingface.co/nithiyn/mathstral-neuron) in our [neuron-compile-jobs](https://huggingface.co/collections/nithiyn/neuron-compile-jobs-66fc4163c5350829c9121e80) collection for Mistral models on HuggingFace.\n",
    "4. If needed, request a quota increase for these resources.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "If using the `sagemaker` python SDK to deploy Mistral model compiled for AWS Neuron to Amazon SageMaker, we need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the `sagemaker` python SDK installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance \n",
    "- [Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html)\n",
    "- For Notebook Instance type, choose `(ml.m5.4xlarge)`, since we will be benchmarking performance in this notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. For Select Kernel, choose [conda_pytorch_p310](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-prepare.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install the required packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set up your [HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/guides/private): \n",
    "- User Access Tokens are the preferred way to authenticate an application to Hugging Face services.\n",
    "- To generate an access token, navigate to the Access Tokens tab in your settings and click on the New token button.\n",
    "- Choose a name for your token and click Generate a token (we recommend keeping the “Role” as read-only). You can then click the Copy button next to your newly-created token to copy it to your clipboard.\n",
    "- Copy and replace this token below in the `HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` parameter under the optimum neuron compile section and the `config` in the deployment section.\n"
