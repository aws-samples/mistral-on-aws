    "# Introducing Mistral Large 2 (24.07)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mistral Large 2](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large-2407/) is an advanced large language model with state-of-the-art reasoning, knowledge, and coding capabilities according to Mistral. Mistral Large 2 is designed for single-node inference with long-context applications in mind – its size of 123 billion parameters allows it to run at large throughput on a single node. A significant effort was also devoted by Mistral to enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. One of Mistral's key focuses during training was to minimize the model's tendency to \"hallucinate,\" or generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or irrelevant information. This was achieved by fine-tuning the model to be more cautious and discerning in its responses, ensuring that it provides reliable and accurate outputs. Additionally, the new Mistral Large is trained to acknowledge when it cannot find solutions or does not have sufficient information to provide a confident answer. Mistral Large 2 sets a new frontier in terms of performance / cost of serving on evaluation metrics. In particular, on MMLU, the pretrained version achieves an accuracy of 84.0%, and sets a new point on the performance/cost Pareto front of open models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is currently generally available for use on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), check out the [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/mistral-large-2-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/) post for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be demonstrating a number of different features like multilingual capabilities (optimized for character-based languages), function calling and tool use, json output, math and reasoning, and code generation with Bedrock's [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html).\n",
