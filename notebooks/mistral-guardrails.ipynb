    "## Use Cases Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Applying Guardrails to Input and Output Content\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case demonstrates how guardrails are applied to both user inputs and model outputs to ensure content safety and appropriateness. The `apply_guardrail` function is used to process content through various policy filters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Policy**: Filters for inappropriate content like sexual, violent, or hateful language.\n",
    "- **Word Policy**: Blocks specific words (e.g., \"discount\") and manages profanity.\n",
    "- **Sensitive Information Policy**: Protects personal identifiable information (PII) like passwords, SSNs, and credit card numbers.\n",
    "- **Topic Policy**: Ensures discussions stay focused on the company's products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Handling Sensitive Information and Blocked Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The code includes examples of how the system handles attempts to input or output sensitive information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It blocks or anonymizes various types of PII.\n",
    "- It prevents the disclosure of sensitive business information like passwords or AWS access keys.\n",
    "- The system provides appropriate responses when blocked content is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Managing Brand Consistency and Competitor Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "The guardrails are set up to maintain brand consistency and avoid inappropriate competitor comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The topic policy ensures discussions focus on the company's own products.\n",
    "- Examples show how the system handles requests to compare products with competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Dealing with Inappropriate User Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The code includes test cases for handling potentially problematic user inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It demonstrates how the system responds to insults or aggressive language.\n",
    "- It shows how attempts at prompt injection or malicious instructions are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Checking for Hallucinations Using Contextual Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case shows how the system detects potential hallucinations or inaccuracies in the model's responses. The `check_hallucination` function uses contextual grounding to compare the model's output against a reference source:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It calculates relevance and grounding scores for each response.\n",
    "- Responses are flagged as hallucinations if they fall below certain thresholds.\n",
    "- This helps ensure that the chatbot provides accurate information about the company's products and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Integrating with Converse API and Using guardContent\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case demonstrates the integration of guardrails with the Converse API, allowing for more nuanced control over the conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `converse_with_guardrails` function shows how to apply guardrails to both system prompts and user messages.\n",
    "- It uses `guardContent` to selectively apply guardrails to specific parts of the conversation.\n",
    "- Examples show how this can be used to guide the AI's behavior (e.g., being polite and helpful) while still allowing flexibility in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These use cases collectively demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock guardrails can be implemented to create a safe, accurate, and brand-consistent e-commerce chatbot experience, while protecting sensitive information and maintaining appropriate boundaries in customer interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll explore the core functions used to apply guardrails to both input and output content in our e-commerce chatbot, with a focus on the **ApplyGuardrail API**. This API offers several advantages for implementing content safety in AI applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decoupling from Foundation Model Execution**: The API allows you to apply guardrails independently of the foundation model execution. This separation provides more flexibility in how and when you apply content safety measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Versatility**: You can use the API with any foundation model, including custom or third-party models, not just those provided by Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-grained Control**: The API enables you to apply guardrails to specific parts of your application's content, giving you more precise control over content safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**: By decoupling guardrail application from model execution, you can potentially reduce costs and improve performance by only applying guardrails when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hallucination Detection**: The API includes features for detecting potential hallucinations in model outputs, enhancing the reliability of AI-generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information on these benefits and how to implement them, refer to the [Amazon Bedrock documentation on using the ApplyGuardrail API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-use-independent-api.html).\n",

    "The `invoke_model_with_guardrails` function demonstrates a comprehensive approach to applying guardrails in AI interactions using the InvokeModel API. It begins by checking the input prompt against predefined guardrails, immediately halting the process and returning intervention details if any violations are detected. If the input passes this initial check, the function proceeds to format the prompt for the Mistral model and invokes it using the Bedrock client, with specific parameters controlling the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    ">While this approach using InvokeModel can be applied to conversation applications, it's important to note that for more advanced conversational interactions, Amazon Bedrock recommends using the Converse API. This is why in Use Case 3, we demonstrate how guardrails can be seamlessly integrated with the Converse API.\n",
    "The objective of showcasing both approaches is to illustrate that guardrails can work smoothly with all available API options in Amazon Bedrock, providing flexibility for different use cases and application requirements. For more detailed information on conversational inference and the Converse API, you can refer to the [Amazon Bedrock documentation on conversation inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html).\n",

    "After obtaining the model's response, the function applies another round of guardrails to the output. If either the input or output guardrails intervene, the function returns a detailed dictionary containing the guardrail-modified text, the type of guardrail that intervened (input or output), and specific details about the intervention. In cases where no interventions occur, the function simply returns an empty dictionary, allowing the original model output to be used.\n",

    "## 2. Checking for Hallucinations Using Contextual Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, we demonstrate how to implement a hallucination detection mechanism for our e-commerce chatbot using Amazon Bedrock's contextual grounding feature. Hallucinations in AI-generated content refer to instances where the model produces information that is not accurate or not grounded in the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check_hallucination` function utilizes the contextual grounding policy to compare the model's output against a reference source and the original user query. This process helps ensure that the chatbot's responses are both relevant to the user's question and accurately grounded in the company's actual policies and product information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grounding and Relevance Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The contextual grounding check uses two filtering parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grounding Threshold**: This represents the minimum confidence score for a model response to be considered grounded. Responses with scores below this threshold are deemed to contain information not supported by the reference source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relevance Threshold**: This is the minimum confidence score for a model response to be considered relevant to the user's query. Responses scoring below this threshold are considered off-topic or not addressing the user's question adequately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both parameters can be set with values between 0 and 0.99, allowing fine-tuning of the strictness of the hallucination detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Scores and Thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "For each model response, the contextual grounding check generates confidence scores for both grounding and relevance. These scores are compared against the set thresholds to determine if a response should be allowed or blocked. For example, if both thresholds are set to 0.7, any response scoring below 0.7 in either grounding or relevance will be flagged as a hallucination and blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our example with an e-commerce chatbot that is designed to answer questions about product features and return policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source:\n",
    "- Our company sells high-quality electronics and offers a 30-day return policy for all products.\n",
    "- The latest smartphone model X1 has a 6.5-inch display, 128GB storage, and 5G capability.\n",
    "- We offer free shipping on orders over $100.\n",
    "- Our premium laptop Y2 comes with a 1-year warranty.\n",
    "- Customer support is available 24/7 via chat or phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above source, there can be four scenarios depending on the user's query:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grounded and Relevant Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grounding source:** \"Our company sells high-quality electronics and offers a 30-day return policy for all products.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query:** \"What's your return policy for electronics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content to guard:** \"We offer a 30-day return policy for all our electronics products.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is both grounded and relevant. It accurately reflects the information provided in the grounding source and directly answers the user's query about the return policy for electronics. This would have high grounding and relevance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ungrounded but Relevant Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grounding source:** \"Our company sells high-quality electronics and offers a 30-day return policy for all products.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query:** \"What's your return policy for electronics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content to guard:** \"We have a 60-day return policy for all our electronics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is relevant to the query as it addresses the return policy for electronics. However, it's ungrounded because it states a 60-day policy, which contradicts the 30-day policy mentioned in the grounding source. This would have a high relevance score but a low grounding score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grounded but Irrelevant Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grounding source:** \"Our company sells high-quality electronics and offers a 30-day return policy for all products.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query:** \"What's your return policy for electronics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content to guard:** \"Our company sells high-quality electronics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is grounded as it uses information directly from the grounding source. However, it's irrelevant because it doesn't answer the query about the return policy. Instead, it provides information about the quality of products. This would have a high grounding score but a low relevance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ungrounded and Irrelevant Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grounding source:** \"Our company sells high-quality electronics and offers a 30-day return policy for all products.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query:** \"What's your return policy for electronics?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content to guard:** \"We offer free shipping on all orders over $100.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is neither grounded nor relevant. It doesn't use any information from the grounding source about the return policy, and it doesn't answer the user's question about returns. Instead, it provides unrelated information about shipping. This would have both low grounding and low relevance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples demonstrate how the contextual grounding check can identify responses that may be hallucinations (ungrounded) or off-topic (irrelevant), ensuring that the e-commerce chatbot provides accurate and pertinent information to customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this feature, we can:\n",
    "- Enhance the reliability of the chatbot's responses\n",
    "- Prevent the dissemination of incorrect information about products or policies\n",
    "- Improve customer trust by ensuring consistent and accurate information\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case is particularly crucial for e-commerce applications where providing accurate product information and company policies is essential for customer satisfaction and legal compliance."

    "## 3. Integrating with Converse API and Using guardContent\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case demonstrates how to integrate guardrails with the Amazon Bedrock Converse API and utilize the `guardContent` feature for fine-grained control over content moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Converse API Integration**: \n",
    "   - Allows for more natural, multi-turn conversations with the AI model.\n",
    "   - Enables the application of guardrails to both system prompts and user messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **guardContent Feature**:\n",
    "   - Provides granular control over which parts of the conversation are subject to guardrails.\n",
    "   - Can be applied to specific portions of user messages or system prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Enhanced content safety in conversational AI applications.\n",
    "   - Flexibility to apply different levels of moderation to different parts of the conversation.\n",
    "   - Improved control over AI-generated responses while maintaining conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Uses the `converse_with_guardrails` function to handle Bedrock API calls and guardrail application.\n",
    "   - Demonstrates various scenarios with and without `guardContent` for comparison.\n",

    "The `converse_with_guardrails` function, which uses the Amazon Bedrock's Converse API, takes user messages, an example identifier, and an optional system prompt as inputs, constructs a configuration including model ID, messages, guardrail settings, and inference parameters. The function then applies this configuration to the Converse API, handling both system prompts and user messages. It provides detailed logging of each interaction, including whether a system prompt is used, and manages error handling by printing detailed information if the API call fails. This function enables complex, multi-turn conversations with applied guardrails, offering flexibility and control in AI-driven dialogues while ensuring safety and consistency in the Mistral Large responses. For additional information, refer to the [Amazon Bedrock documentation on using a guardrail with the Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails-use-converse-api.html)"

    "### Converse API Guardrail Examples\n",
    "This section demonstrates various examples of using the [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html) with guardrails in an e-commerce chatbot context. This set of examples below showcases the flexibility of the guardrail system, demonstrating how it can be applied selectively to different parts of the conversation, including system prompts and user messages. Here's a breakdown of each example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1**: Comparing without and with guardContent\n",
    "   - 1a asks about products and competitors without guardrails\n",
    "   - 1b splits the question, applying guardContent to the competitor comparison part\n",
    "2. **Example 2**: Using system prompts with and without guardContent\n",
    "   - 2a uses a system prompt without guardContent\n",
    "   - 2b applies guardContent to both the system prompt and part of the user message\n",
    "3. **Example 3**: Simple query without system prompt or guardContent\n",
    "4. **Example 4**: Using both system prompt and guardContent\n",
    "   - Applies guardContent to the system prompt and part of the user message\n",
    "5. **Example 5**: Using guardContent only for the system prompt\n",
    "   - Shows how to apply guardrails to the system prompt while leaving the user message unguarded\n",
    "6. **Example 6**: Demonstrating word policy effects\n",
    "   - 6a uses a message that should be blocked by the word policy (asking for a discount)\n",
    "   - 6b attempts to bypass the word policy by using guardContent and alternative phrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example calls the `converse_with_guardrails` function with different configurations of messages, system prompts, and guardContent. The responses are then printed using the `print_converse_response` function.\n"

    "## Overall Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guardrail Effectiveness:\n",
    "   - The guardrails successfully intercepted and blocked inappropriate content, sensitive information, and off-topic discussions across various test cases.\n",
    "   - Both input and output guardrails demonstrated their ability to filter content effectively, providing a comprehensive safety net for the chatbot interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hallucination Detection:\n",
    "   - The contextual grounding feature proved effective in identifying potential hallucinations by comparing model responses against reference information.\n",
    "   - Relevance and grounding scores provided quantitative measures to assess the accuracy of model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Converse API Integration:\n",
    "   - The integration of guardrails with the Converse API allowed for more nuanced control over multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "   - The use of `guardContent` demonstrated the ability to apply guardrails selectively to specific parts of messages or system prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Word Policy and Topic Control:\n",
    "   - The word policy effectively blocked attempts to discuss sensitive topics like discounts.\n",
    "   - Topic control helped maintain focus on the company's products and services, avoiding competitor comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sensitive Information Handling:\n",
    "   - The guardrails successfully identified and blocked various types of personally identifiable information (PII), enhancing data protection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Flexibility of Guardrail Application:\n",
    "   - The ability to apply guardrails differently to system prompts and user messages provided a flexible approach to content moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Decoupling Guardrails from Foundation Models:\n",
    "   - The ApplyGuardrail API demonstrated the ability to decouple guardrails from specific foundation models, allowing for more versatile and model-agnostic content moderation.\n",
    "   - This decoupling enables the application of consistent safety measures across different AI models, including custom or third-party foundation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of guardrails using Amazon Bedrock for an e-commerce chatbot has demonstrated significant benefits in ensuring safe, accurate, and on-topic interactions. The multi-faceted approach, combining content policies, word filters, topic control, and contextual grounding, provides a robust framework for maintaining content quality and protecting sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key achievements of this implementation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enhanced content safety through effective filtering of inappropriate language and topics.\n",
