    "# Guide to deploy, benchmark, and profile Mistral Small 2501 with NXDI and VLLM on Trn1\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide for serving, profiling, and running benchmarks on Mistral Small 24B model on a **Trn1** instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistral Small 2501\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mistral Small 3.0](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3) is a 24B-parameter language model from Mistral AI optimized for low-latency performance across common AI tasks. Released under the Apache 2.0 license, it features both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions designed for efficient local deployment. The model achieves 81% accuracy on the MMLU benchmark and performs competitively with larger models like Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 32B, while operating at three times the speed on equivalent hardware.\n",

    "[NxD Inference](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/nxdi-overview.html#nxdi-overview) (where NxD stands for NeuronX Distributed) is an open-source PyTorch-based inference library that simplifies deep learning model deployment on AWS Inferentia and Trainium instances. Introduced with Neuron SDK 2.21 release, it offers advanced inference capabilities, including features such as continuous batching and speculative decoding for high performance inference. Additionally, it supports inference engine for vLLM for seamless integration with the majority of customers’ production deployment systems. ML developers can use NxD Inference library at different levels of abstraction that fits their inference use case.\n",

    "Profiles from multi-worker jobs (i.e. more than one NeuronCore) can either be viewed individually or in a combined collectives view. Since profile data is often similar between workers and processing profile data for all workers can be time-consuming, it is recommended to first explore the profile for a single worker or small subset of workers. Viewing the profile for a specific worker is the same as for single-worker profiles."
