    "## Introduction to Mistral OCR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mistral OCR** is a specialized optical character recognition model designed for extracting text, images, tables, and mathematical expressions from documents. Unlike traditional OCR models that only extract text, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents and returns ordered interleaved text and images in markdown format, making it ideal for multimodal document understanding and RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves 94.89% overall accuracy on benchmarks, outperforming Google Document AI (83.42%), Azure OCR (89.52%), Gemini models (88-90%), and GPT-4o (89.77%)\n",
    "- **Complex Document Understanding**: Excels at processing interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting\n",
    "- **Natively Multilingual**: Parses, understands, and transcribes thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents with 99%+ accuracy\n",
    "- **Multi-format Support**: Process images (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.) and multi-page PDF documents\n",
    "- **Doc-as-Prompt & Structured Output**: Use documents as prompts and extract information into structured formats like JSON for downstream function calls and agent building\n",
    "- **RAG-Ready**: Ideal model for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with multimodal documents such as slides or complex PDFs\n",
    "- **Production-Ready**: Deploy on Amazon SageMaker, la Plateforme, or self-host for organizations with stringent data privacy requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral OCR excels across multiple dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Mistral OCR 2503 | Best Competitor |\n",

    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Digitization**: Convert scanned documents, receipts, forms, and historical archives into searchable, AI-ready text\n",
    "2. **Scientific Research**: Extract text, equations, tables, charts, and figures from scientific papers and journals\n",
    "3. **Handwriting Recognition**: Process handwritten notes, whiteboard images, and forms\n",
    "4. **Multimodal RAG Systems**: Build intelligent document understanding pipelines by combining Mistral OCR with LLMs like Mistral Small for analysis and summarization\n",
    "5. **Multi-language Processing**: Handle documents in diverse linguistic backgrounds, from global organizations to hyperlocal businesses\n",
    "6. **Structured Data Extraction**: Extract specific information from documents and format it into JSON for automated workflows and agent systems\n",
    "7. **Cultural Heritage Preservation**: Digitize historical documents and artifacts for preservation and accessibility\n",

    "## Understanding Mistral OCR Response Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral OCR returns document content as **Markdown with interleaved text and images**, preserving the document structure and layout hierarchy. This format is optimized for downstream processing by LLMs and provides precise positioning information through bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Document Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral OCR can extract and recognize a wide variety of document elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard typed text** - Regular printed text in any font\n",
    "- **Multilingual text** - Mixed scripts (e.g., Asian and Roman characters)\n",
    "- **Mathematical expressions** - Formulas, equations, and LaTeX notation\n",
    "- **Handwriting** - Handwritten notes and annotations\n",
    "- **Strikethrough text** - Text with strikethrough formatting\n",
    "- **Diverse layout formats** - Complex page layouts and structures\n",
    "- **Multi-column tables** - Tables with multiple columns and complex structures\n",
    "- **Text with specific bounding boxes** - Precise spatial positioning\n",
    "- **Text on colored backgrounds** - Text overlaid on colored regions\n",
    "- **Form elements** - Checkboxes and circle selection fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses are returned in **Markdown format** with:\n",
    "- Structural elements like pipes (`|`), LaTeX, and tables\n",
    "- Layout cues that help LLMs understand document hierarchy\n",
    "- Image placeholders embedded in the text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Images within documents are represented as Markdown image syntax:\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The image ID (e.g., `img-0.jpeg`) maps to the `pages[n].images` array, which contains:\n",
    "- **Bounding box coordinates** (`top_left_x`, `top_left_y`, `bottom_right_x`, `bottom_right_y`)\n",
    "- **Base64-encoded payload** (optional)\n",
    "- **Image annotations** (if applicable)\n",

    "### Step 2: Create Agent Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll define the **tools** that agents can use to interact with documents and perform analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Agent Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Strands Agents, tools are Python functions decorated with `@tool` that agents can call during their reasoning process. Think of them as the \"hands\" of the agent - they enable agents to:\n",
    "- Access external data (OCR extraction)\n",
    "- Query databases (document listing)\n",
    "- Perform computations (duplicate detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools We're Creating\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`extract_document_text(doc_id)`**\n",
    "   - Calls Mistral OCR to extract text from a document\n",
    "   - Implements caching to avoid redundant API calls\n",
    "   - Returns structured JSON with document metadata and OCR text\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`list_documents(doc_type)`**\n",
    "   - Lists all available documents, optionally filtered by type\n",
    "   - Helps agents discover what documents need processing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`check_duplicate_invoice(doc_id, vendor, amount, date)`**\n",
    "   - Compares invoice details against previously processed documents\n",
    "   - Detects potential duplicate submissions\n",
    "   - Returns match results with confidence indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Agents Use Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "When an agent needs information, it:\n",
    "1. Decides which tool to call based on its task\n",
    "2. Generates the appropriate parameters\n",
    "3. Receives the tool output\n",
    "4. Incorporates the results into its reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to how ChatGPT uses function calling, but orchestrated within a multi-agent workflow."

    "#### What This Orchestrator Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Management**: Tracks all intermediate results in `DocumentWorkflowState`\n",
    "2. **Sequential Execution**: Each step builds on previous results\n",
    "3. **Agent Coordination**: Routes documents to appropriate specialist agents\n",
    "4. **Progress Tracking**: Displays real-time progress with emojis and status updates\n",
    "5. **Performance Metrics**: Measures execution time and agent invocations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auditability**: Complete trace of which agents processed which documents\n",
    "- **Debugging**: State object shows intermediate results at each step\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Easy to add new workflow steps or parallel processing\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Modify agent behavior without changing orchestration logic"
