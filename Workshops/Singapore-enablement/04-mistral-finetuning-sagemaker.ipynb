    "# Part 2: Why Fine-tune?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Understanding Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning** is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on your specific dataset to adapt it to your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Fine-tune vs. Use Base Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Fine-tune When:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain-Specific Language**: Your use case involves specialized terminology\n",
    "   - Medical, legal, financial, technical documentation\n",
    "   - Company-specific jargon or processes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistent Style/Tone**: You need predictable output formatting\n",
    "   - Customer service responses with specific tone\n",
    "   - Technical documentation with consistent structure\n",
    "   - Brand voice alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved Accuracy**: Base model doesn't perform well on your task\n",
    "   - Specialized classification tasks\n",
    "   - Domain-specific question answering\n",
    "   - Custom entity recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cost Optimization**: Smaller fine-tuned models can replace larger base models\n",
    "   - Fine-tuned 7B model may match 70B model performance on specific tasks\n",
    "   - Lower inference costs\n",
    "   - Faster response times\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Don't Fine-tune When:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Data**: You have fewer than 100-200 quality examples\n",
    "2. **General Tasks**: Base model already performs well\n",
    "3. **Rapidly Changing Requirements**: Your use case changes frequently\n",
    "4. **Prompt Engineering Works**: You can achieve good results with clever prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Fine-tuning Mistral Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benefit | Description | Impact |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|--------|\n",
    "| **Performance** | Higher accuracy on domain-specific tasks | 20-40% improvement |\n",
    "| **Consistency** | More predictable outputs | Reduced variance |\n",
    "| **Efficiency** | Shorter prompts needed | 50-70% token savings |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Smaller model can replace larger one | 5-10x cost reduction |\n",
    "| **Latency** | Faster inference with optimized model | 2-3x speed improvement |\n",
    "| **Privacy** | Keep sensitive data in training, not prompts | Enhanced security |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: Customer support chatbot for a SaaS company\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Before Fine-tuning**: \n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔬 What is LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that dramatically reduces the computational and memory requirements of fine-tuning large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Fine-tuning vs. LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Full Fine-tuning:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Model: 7B parameters\n",
    "Training: Updates ALL 7B parameters\n",
    "Memory Required: ~28GB (for model weights)\n",
    "Training Time: 10-20 hours\n",
    "Storage: 14GB (full model copy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LoRA Fine-tuning:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Model: 7B parameters (frozen)\n",
    "Training: Updates only ~4-8M parameters (0.05%!)\n",
    "Memory Required: ~12GB\n",
    "Training Time: 1-3 hours\n",
    "Storage: 16MB (just the LoRA adapters)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How LoRA Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of modifying the original model weights, LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Freezes** the original pre-trained weights\n",
    "2. **Injects** trainable low-rank matrices into each layer\n",
    "3. **Trains** only these small adapter matrices\n",
    "4. **Combines** the frozen weights with adapters during inference\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Mathematical representation:\n",
    "# Original: h = W₀x\n",
    "# LoRA: h = W₀x + BAx\n",
    "# Where:\n",
    "#   W₀ = frozen pre-trained weights (large)\n",
    "#   B, A = trainable low-rank matrices (small)\n",
    "#   BA = the adapter (rank r << model dimension)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key LoRA Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Rank (r)**\n",
    "- **What it is**: Dimensionality of the low-rank matrices\n",
    "- **Typical values**: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\n",
    "- **Trade-off**:\n",
    "  - Lower rank (4-8): Faster, less memory, fewer parameters, may underfit\n",
    "  - Higher rank (32-64): Slower, more memory, more parameters, better capacity\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Start with 16, increase if underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Alpha (α)**\n",
    "- **What it is**: Scaling factor for LoRA updates\n",
    "- **Typical values**: 16, 32, 64 (often 2x the rank)\n",
    "- **Formula**: `scaling = alpha / rank`\n",
    "- **Effect**: Controls how much the adapters influence the output\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: Set to 2x your rank value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Target Modules**\n",
    "- **What it is**: Which layers to apply LoRA to\n",
    "- **Common choices**:\n",
    "  - `[\"q_proj\", \"v_proj\"]`: Attention query and value (minimal)\n",
    "  - `[\"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"o_proj\"]`: All attention (recommended)\n",
    "  - `[\"q_proj\", \"k_proj\", \"v_proj\", \"o_proj\", \"gate_proj\", \"up_proj\", \"down_proj\"]`: Attention + FFN (maximum)\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: More modules = better adaptation but slower training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Dropout**\n",
    "- **What it is**: Regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Typical values**: 0.05, 0.1\n",
    "- **Effect**: Randomly drops connections during training\n",
    "- **Recommendation**: 0.05 for large datasets, 0.1 for small datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRA Configuration Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lora_config = LoraConfig(\n",
    "    r=16,                    # Rank: balance between capacity and efficiency\n",
    "    lora_alpha=32,          # Alpha: 2x rank for stable training\n",
    "    target_modules=[        # Apply to all attention layers\n",
    "        \"q_proj\",           # Query projection\n",
    "        \"k_proj\",           # Key projection  \n",
    "        \"v_proj\",           # Value projection\n",
    "        \"o_proj\"            # Output projection\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    lora_dropout=0.05,      # Light regularization\n",
    "    bias=\"none\",            # Don't train bias terms\n",
    "    task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\"   # Causal language modeling\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Benefit | Quantified |\n",
    "|--------|---------|------------|\n",
    "| **Memory** | Reduced GPU memory usage | 50-70% less |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Faster training | 2-3x faster |\n",
    "| **Storage** | Tiny adapter files | 16MB vs 14GB |\n",
    "| **Flexibility** | Multiple adapters per model | Unlimited tasks |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Lower compute requirements | 60-80% cheaper |\n",
    "| **Quality** | Comparable to full fine-tuning | 95-98% performance |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Perfect for**:\n",
    "- Limited GPU memory (< 24GB)\n",
    "- Multiple task-specific models\n",
    "- Rapid experimentation\n",
    "- Production deployments (easy to swap adapters)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Consider full fine-tuning if**:\n",
    "- You need maximum possible performance\n",
    "- You have unlimited compute budget\n",
    "- The task requires fundamental model changes\n",

    "\n",
    "# Part 4: Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Preparing Your Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality data is crucial for successful fine-tuning. Let's understand the format and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Format: JSONL (JSON Lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line is a complete JSON object representing one training example:\n",

    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Desired response\"}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Size**:\n",
    "   - Minimum: 100-200 examples\n",
    "   - Recommended: 500-1,000 examples\n",
    "   - Optimal: 1,000-10,000 examples\n",
    "   - More data = better generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality over Quantity**:\n",
    "   - One high-quality example > ten mediocre ones\n",
    "   - Ensure responses are accurate and consistent\n",
    "   - Remove contradictory examples\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diversity**:\n",
    "   - Cover different phrasings of similar questions\n",
    "   - Include edge cases\n",
    "   - Represent real-world distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Length**:\n",
    "   - Keep examples under 2048 tokens when possible\n",
    "   - Longer examples = slower training\n",
    "   - Balance between context and efficiency\n",

    "- **Typical values**: 1e-5 to 5e-4\n",
    "- **Guidelines**:\n",
    "  - Full fine-tuning: 1e-5 to 5e-5 (smaller)\n",
    "  - LoRA: 1e-4 to 5e-4 (larger, because fewer parameters)\n",
    "  - Large dataset: Lower learning rate\n",
    "  - Small dataset: Higher learning rate\n",
