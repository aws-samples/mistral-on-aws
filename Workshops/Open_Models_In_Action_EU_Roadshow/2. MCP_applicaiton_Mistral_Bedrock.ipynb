    "\n",

    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **MCP Host**:Maintains conversation, initiates MCP clients and has helper functions such as supporting image processing.\n",
    "2. **MCP Clients**: Communication component within the host that connects to MCP servers.\n",
    "3. **MCP Servers**: Connect to specific data sources (files, APIs, databases) and serve that data back through the protocol, providing specific tools (like time, maps,file access).\n",
    "4. **Bedrock AI Models**: Provide LLM capabilities to understand user questions, decide which MCP tools to use, and generate the final answer.\n",
